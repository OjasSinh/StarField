# StarField

A lightweight starfield animation built using **p5.js**.  
This project was inspired by *The Coding Train* and their creative coding challenges.  
It recreates the classic flying-through-space effect using simple JavaScript and drawing logic.

## Preview

## Features
- Dynamic starfield animation  
- Depth-based motion for a 3D feel  
- Smooth rendering using the p5.js drawing loop  
- Clean and modular project structure
